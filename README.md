# BasicWebpage

This is the first ever webpage that i created using the knowledge from an edX course that covers the basics of web programming.
This webpage is not connected to a server and does not involve any backend programming. It was simply done to practise my HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap skills.
